# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

# How to use this starter code

###   Install NodeJS  ü§ó
you can get the Latest version of NodeJS from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) [The Official NodeJS website] follow the instructions and you‚Äôre Good to go.

### Run npm install  ü§ì
		this will install all the dependecies in you machine

### Getting started with database üßê
The database user here is [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) which  is a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. You can get started with mongoose (https://mongoosejs.com/docs/) or you can read thisawesome article on getting started with [Mongoose](https://medium.com/@scalegridio/getting-started-with-mongodb-and-mongoose-c406541d325a). Fill your databse url in the keys_dev.js file inside the config folder.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
